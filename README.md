# AP_project

hi this is ap project

group name:c++(=31)

group number=9




#MESSENGER :

STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FRIENDS

JOIN TO GROUPS AND CHANNELS

JOIN YOUR FRIENDS GROUP AND CHAT WITH THEM

CREATE YOUR OWN CHANNEL AND PUBLISH WHATEVER YOU WANT 







#SAVE DATA IN HARD DISK:


DATA storage in json files

when someone logs into program  , a file named main_user.json will be created

and we have 3 folders for save users,chats and groups information(everyyhing has a .json file)

if you log in you can use program until you log out







#SERVER STATUS :

server responses slowly  so please wait for changes and  execute commands, and please dont click again just wait a few seconds .we are so sorry about that but
that isnt our mistake (server was written) 








#CLEAN ARCHITECTUrE:

we built our program bassed on clean architecture principles:
#ENTITIES classes:

chat,user,group,channel,main_user

#USE CASES:

send and receive message
create group and channel
join into group and channel
log out
log in
sign up
find user
.
.
......


#CONTOROLER class:

Mainwindow


#VIEW classes(UI)

main_page

sign_up

log_in

create_channe

create_group

join_group

join_channel

new_user

.
.
.

......







#POLYMORPHISM:

most of classes inherits from QObject

chat class is an abstract class that channel,group,user inherit from



#THREAD:
every 1500 ms program updates(server responses slowly ) 


#INSTALL

you can easily install my program to make use from app easier
just extract messenger installer.zip and run messenger.exe to install app everywhere you want and then just run application and enjoy :)
